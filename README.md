- You can start the application as a simple java jar application

- default port is 8080

- security is disabled because it's not fully completed

- unit test is not completed

- integration test is not completed

- functionality is completed except the security part

The following is the available services example

1- http://localhost:8080/comment [post/json]
{
"text":"test1"
}

2- http://localhost:8080/comment [get/json]

3- http://localhost:8080/comment/reject/1 [put/json]

4- http://localhost:8080/comment/approve/1 [put/json]
